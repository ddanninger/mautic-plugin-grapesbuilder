Grapesjs integration for Mautic

## Installation

@TODO

## Mautic Plugin

1. Open the Grapebuilder via the list actions
2. Modify & Save
3. **BE AWARE:** After modification via grapesjs the mode will be changed to "code mode"
4. Be happy =)

## Feature Roadmap

1. ~~Implement Grapesjs for Landing Pages~~
2. ~~Implement Grapesjs for Emails~~
3. ~~Save content via original forms~~
4. MJML Integration
5. Themes should be still editable in the original Landingpage without programmatically changing to "code mode"
